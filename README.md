# Tasky

## A Trello clone for task management but without all those pesky features.

Messing around with Python Flask. Will work on more features once the core ideas are there. Might turn into something else - who knows!

virtualenv, python 2.7+

### Install

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run

mongod (on the default port:27017)
